# 👋 Hey there! Welcome to the Castle

> *“Tech and Coding doesn’t have to be dull — and learning shouldn’t feel like homework.”*  
> — Me. Just now.

Hi, I’m **Dan Taiye Aremu**, but online I go by **Castle** 👑. I'm a Data Engineer, Software Developer, and lifelong knowledge-sharer. I hope to help people turn confusion into clarity — whether it's building data pipelines, wrangling cloud services, or demystifying full-stack applications.

I believe in **learning out loud**, building with intent, and explaining things like you’re five — but five with elite dev instincts.

## 👑 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: **open-source data engineering tools and Airflow-powered pipelines**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: **Advanced ML Ops, graph databases, and the fine art of writing shorter emails**
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: **tutorials, devtools, data-driven projects, and maybe a startup?**
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: **convincing more devs to love (or at least like) data centric engineering**
- 💬 Ask me about:  
  - Python, SQL, React, Docker, Airflow, Spark, ML, AWS...  
  - Or how to fix a pipeline at 3AM using pure intuition and tea
- 📫 How to reach me: **danaremu.tech@gmail.com** or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/codewithcastle)
- 😄 Pronouns: **He/Him**
- ⚡ Fun fact:  
  One time, I debugged an ETL issue by accident — and I am thinking of writing a blog pretending I meant to.

## 🔥 What I Do (a.k.a. What This Castle Is Made Of)

- 🧠 **Data Engineering**: Building reliable, scalable ETL systems that don’t break when your boss looks at them
- 💻 **Software Dev**: Full-stack apps powered by Python, React, PHP, JavaScript, and zero regrets
- ☁️ **Cloud/DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and cloud-native deployments on AWS & GCP
- 🧪 **ML & AI**: From logistic regression to recommendation systems that know your taste better than your friends
- 📊 **Dashboards & Analytics**: Making data make sense — and making stakeholders say "oooh"

## 🌟 Featured Projects

> Want to dive into some of my favorite builds? Check out:

- 📦 **Inventory Data Pipeline** – ETL meets elegance with Airflow, PostgreSQL, and real-time monitoring
- 🎬 **Movie Recommendation System** – ML-powered movie picks based on your guilty pleasures
- ❤️ **Cardiovascular Disease Detection** – Serious machine learning for serious impact
- ⏱️ **Expected Delivery Time Prediction** – Because "Your order is on the way" isn't data-driven enough

## 📚 What I Teach (a.k.a. Why You're Probably Here)

- How to build data pipelines that don’t cry in production
- How to deploy, automate, scale, and sleep better
- How to *actually* learn machine learning
- And how to not fear Airflow (you’re not alone)

> 🚨 Free content. Zero fluff. Slightly too many puns.  
> Coming soon to a [YouTube](#) channel or [blog](#) near you.
